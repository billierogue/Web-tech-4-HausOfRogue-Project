        The best thing about a boolean is even if you are wrong, you are only off by a bit. (Anonymous) If builders built buildings the way programmers wrote programs, 
        then the first woodpecker that came along would destroy civilization. (Gerald Weinberg). If McDonalds were run like a software company, 
        one out of every hundred Big Macs would give you food poisoning, and the response would be, ‘We’re sorry, here’s a coupon for two more.’ (Mark Minasi) Programming is like sex. One mistake and you have to support it for the rest of your life. (Michael Sinz) First learn computer science and all the theory. Next develop a programming style. Then forget all that and just hack. (George Carrette) Hardware: The parts of a computer system that can be kicked. (Jeff Pesis)
